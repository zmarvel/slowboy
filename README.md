# slowboy

slowboy aims to be the slowest Game Boy emulator. Just kiddingâ€”but the goal of
this project isn't to create a fast emulator, since those already exist. The
goal of the project is simple: try to write an emulator in Python that will
perform reasonably on modern low-end hardware. If performance is one of the
goals, why Python? Well, another goal of the project is to provide an
easy-to-read codebase for others who want to emulate this system.

## TODO

* CPU instructions that don't require MMU
* MMU
* CPU instructions that require MMU
* Graphics
* Audio

## Installation

So far this emulator doesn't do enough to make installation useful.

## Development

To hack on this project, just clone the repository. I'm using Python's
`unittest` for now.
